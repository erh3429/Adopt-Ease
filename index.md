# About Me

Hi, I'm Ethan Hower. I come from a county in PA called Lebanon, known for its balogna (yes, that is really what we are known for). I went to Cedar Crest High School, which was a pretty good experience. We had a pretty good computer science program at my high school thanks to an amazing teacher, so I am fortunate to have a bit of background in computer science and the Software Engineering Life Cycle. In my free time I like to play video games with my friends, I enjoy ping pong and tennis, and I am a big fan of board games. I chose RIT because there were numerous alumni from my school who went to RIT and spoke very highly of it. I am excited to participate in the Software Engineering program, and I look forward to expanding my knowledge in order to prepare for a future career in software engineering.

## What I Want to Learn
- How to work efficiently with a team
- How to properly organize a large/difficult task
- An idea of what my future software engineering classes will look like
